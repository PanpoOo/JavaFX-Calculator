# 📱 JavaFX Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator application built using **JavaFX**.  
It features a clean user interface and supports fundamental arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **clear**, and **equals**.

## 🛠️ About the Project

The calculator includes:
- A display area (non-editable `TextField`)
- Number buttons from 0 to 9
- Operation buttons: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `C`, and `=`
- Responsive UI with hover and press effects on buttons
- Layout organized using `VBox` and `HBox`

It's a beginner-friendly project showcasing JavaFX UI and event handling.

## 💡 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:
- **Button arrays for cleaner loops**:
  ```java
  Button[] numberButtons = {button1, button2, ..., button0};
  Button[] operation = {buttonPlus, buttonMinus, buttonMultiply, buttonDivide};
  ```
  Grouping buttons in arrays made it easier to use loops and avoid repeated code.

- **Using enhanced for-loops** to apply actions and styles to multiple buttons:
  ```java
  for (Button button : numberButtons) {
      // Set size, styles, and action handlers
  }
  ```

- **Implementing core functions** like:
  - `+` Addition
  - `-` Subtraction
  - `*` Multiplication
  - `/` Division
  - `=` Equals (to calculate the result)
  - `C` Clear (to reset everything)

- **Styling JavaFX UI** with inline CSS and adding interactive effects like hover and pressed states.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add support for decimal numbers
- Add keyboard input support
- Improve error handling (e.g., division by zero)
